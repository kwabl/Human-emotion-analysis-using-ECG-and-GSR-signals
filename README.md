# Human-emotion-analysis-using-ECG-and-GSR-signals
This study used the YAAD, which consists of Electrocardiogram (ECG) and Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) measurements designed explicitly for emotion recognition in young adults (Dar et al., 2022). The data was gathered from 25 participants using wearable Shimmer3 ECG and GSR sensors. It consists of three main components: raw physiological data, extracted ECG and GSR features, and self-annotation labels provided by the participants. Features will be extracted using
